# Word-Guess-Cons

<h2> Description</h2>
<h4> This is a word guess game node app. A user is required to guess a letter to match the word the computer chose. </h4>

<h2> How does it work ? </h2>
<h4> The app takes the user input and matches it through an array of words. If it matches, the letter replaces a dash in the word to guess. if it doesn't, the guesses number decrements by 1. </h4>

<h3> A demo video is available for download.</h3>
